# Gentoo Repository
This Gentoo repository contains a collection of packages which I either use or have an interest in. They are either unavailable in the main/GURU repo, are outdated in the main/GURU repo, or have features missing I wish to use.

Packages are likely to be GNOME/GTK focused.

## Current Packages
* 📹 media-video/clapper: A GTK4/GStreamer based video player (https://github.com/Rafostar/clapper)
* 🌐 net-misc/escambo: API tester (https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/escambo/)

Check out the linked repositories for more details about each application.
