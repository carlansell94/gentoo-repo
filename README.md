# Gentoo Repository
This Gentoo repository contains a collection of packages which I either use or have an interest in. They are either unavailable in the main/GURU repo, are outdated in the main/GURU repo, or have features missing I wish to use.

Packages are likely to be GNOME/GTK focused.

* ⚒️ dev-tex/citations: Manage your bibliographies using the BibTeX format (https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/citations)

Check out the linked repositories for more details about each application.

## Bundled Crates
Some ebuilds in this repository make use of bundled Rust crates, as is now recommended for Rust-based packages. These bundles are hosted on my website, to reduce the size of files downloaded when syncing the repo.

These packages are not covered by the main repository licence. Please check each package for its individual licence.
